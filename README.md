# Status
Pre-alpha

# Features
- Custom CGA driver
- Custom Keyboard driver
- Custom error handlers
- Made to be run on any IBM PC compatible computer

# Build instructions
You need to install [NASM](https://nasm.us/). Then, run the `build.sh` file. If you are on Windows, it 
shouldn't be hard to imitate the commands inside that file.

# Run instructions
There are two ways:  
- **Not recommended:** Running the OS in a real computer. It must be IBM PC compatible.
- **Recommended:** Using [QEMU](https://qemu.org/). Install it and then run the `run.sh` file.

# Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any damages caused by this Disk Operating System, but this should be safe.
